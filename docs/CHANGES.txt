Release notes, changes and version documentation for the 
Strand Map Service. Current version @VERSION@

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in v1.2.4 (released to production March 9, 2017)

- Moved code from SourceForge to GitHub https://github.com/NCAR/strand-maps-server


Changes in v1.2.35 (released to production March 25, 2014)

- Upgraded prototype to 1.7.1.0
- Fixing the rest of the other IE < 9 errors, (region boxes not click able, drop down menu not working and
  strands not showing up in benchmark pop up). The solutions were to upgrade prototype along with some
  DOM changes, to make it work on all browsers.  
- Fix hasOwnProperty error that seems to be causing errors on ie browsers older then ie 9
- Fixed Android issue of tabs showing up three times. This was caused because of the issue on android browsers where a image
onload even is called three times. Fixed it by listening for the event via prototype instead.
- Fixed open files problem, "Too many files open" error 

Changes in v1.2.33 (released to production Feb 10, 2014)
- Re-organized example_clients folder so the examples are in order and the example number matches the 
  files being used. 

- Wordsmithing of documentation that was added in v1.2.34 to make it clearer.

- Updates to example client1 to make the colors and bubble sizes the same as the NSDL client

Changes in v1.2.33-rc2
- Updated /bubble/resources.jsp to be more flexible so it can be used for all NSDL tabs. Instead
  of having one for each nsdl resource tab.
  
- Added new built in tab called nsdltoppicks. Which displays all nsdl aligned/related resources for
  a benchmark ordered by most relevant up top. The label for tab will include the resource total count
  
- Removed the tabs nsdlaligned and nsdlrelated from documentation so future clients do not use them anymore
  and instead use nsdltoppicks
  
- Added new event to StrandMap called onbenchmarkclose. Which is called when a benchmark is closed. 
  This was then implemented within tabs, so content can be cleared once a benchmark is closed.
 
- Added appendToLabel and changeLabel methods to InfoBubbleTab class so the labels can be dynamically 
   updated, ie total resource counts
   
- Removed event onimageload from StrandMap and moved onload into its place. Therefore there is only
   one event clients have to worry about before accessing any StrandMap methods.
   
- Combined example1 and example2 together to create a common example for clients to use. 
  
Changes in v1.2.33-rc1
- Removing orphan maps, sections and chapters from the database file. To both clean up and the data and
  prevent issues from happening if a client figured out the ids of the orphaned children

Changes in v1.2.32 (release to production Jan 22, 2014)
- Ability to insert text or other HTML content into the interactive maps is 
now avaialble from the JavaScript API
-- New method setMapObjectAnnotation allows a developer to insert text or other HTML content
next to objects in the maps including the benchmarks, text labels (grade bands and strand names),
or anchored to absolute regions (top, left, right, bottom, etc.) on the map or map image.
-- Example client 2 illustrates this new method by displaying the total numeber of NSDL
resources next to each benchmark, grade band, and strand in the map.


Changes in v1.2.31 (released to production Jan 13, 2014)
- Mobile/Touch screen compatibility implemented for the interactive map interface (tested with iPad/iOS 7)
-- Touch-drag now works properly in the map visualizations
-- Map select menu interaction improved for touch compatibility
-- Size of hot spots and links expanded to work better with touch screens
- Strands and grades are now hot-linked in the visualizations
-- Hover-over strands and grades shows underline that indicates it is linked
-- Clicking on a strand or grade brings up the strand/grade visualization
-- Breadcrumbs in the UI now show the full path starting with Chapter > Map > Strand|Grade
- Strands are now available for display in the Benchmark InfoBubble
-- Shows/links all strands that the Benchmark resides in
- Rounded corners for the Benchmark hover-over boxes (previously square)
- Internet Explorer bug fixes
-- Fixed persistent hover link lines that appeared around the benchmarks
-- IE-specific spacing implemented for hover-lines display

Changes in v1.2.31-rc2 (released to test Dec 6 2013)
- Visualization engine improvements:
-- Add code to fix diagonal lines that cross each other.
-- This was added after v1.2.31, since we needed the architecture first

Changes in v1.2.31-rc1 (released to test Dec 6 2013)
- Visualization engine improvements:
-- Changed algorithm to use strand alignments and then combining the strands instead of caches and fudge factors
-- Fixed issue when a benchmark is part of more then one strand in a map but the strands are not side by side. Instead
   now we average the position in the middle
-- Got rid of issue where spacing was randomly found in the map. Now all strands start from the beginning of their area since the strand
   widths are calculated dynamically. 
-- Fixed issue of benchmarks sometimes overlapping each other.

Changes in v1.2.30 (released to producation Nov 8 2013)
- Visualization engine improvements:
-- Changed the default font to DejaVu LGC Sans for improved readability (tested 8 different fonts with 13 users before arriving at this one). 
Requires the dejavu-lgc-fonts.noarch be installed on Linux to pull these in.
-- Changed the heuristic for placement of benchmarks slightly to reduce the occurance of overlapping edges in the Maps
-- Fixed bug where some benchmarks were appearing under the wrong strand. When a given grade
band did not have a benchmark under a given strand, all benchmarks for that band were
shifted left. This has now been fixed.
-- Renamed the Java class for the visualization engine from my_process_old to Visualization
- Implemented persistent cache of CSIP responses to improve response times for page and image loads. Cache refreshes when a
newer version of the DB file (strandmap.sql) is deployed. Cache files can/should be deleted to refresh if other
changes are made in the vizualization engine.
- Updated code to run in Tomcat 6
-- Changed build.xml to point to the new directory structure for tomcat so it can be built with
newer versions of tomcat (TC6). 
-- Added in stub methods to myResultSet so it can compile correctly for Java 6

Changes in v1.2.29 (released to production Aug 29 2013)
- New NGSS InfoBubble tab showing NGSS standards that are aligned to a given Benchmark. Includes alignments from SMS ID to NGSS ASN ID.

Changes in v1.2.28 (released May 20, 2013)
- map queries for only a bm id (no map id provided) will use the same functionality as the providing asnid only to pull up a map with that benchmark highlighted.  Code traverses up to the first MAP associated with the benchmark.

Changes in v1.2.27 (released May 9, 2013)
- map queries for asnid that have a corresponding SMS-BMK in the database will pull up a map with that benchmark highlighted.  Code traverses up to the first MAP associated with the benchmark.  This is based off of a programatic matching of ASN ID text to SMS-BMK text and we're still waiting for the officially correlated list from Brian Sweeney of AAAS.

Changes in v1.2.26 (released Apr 16, 2013)
- added a new db table that matched ASN IDs to the SMS-BMK IDs where available.  Also includes
  partial implementation of new features based off of these matches that includes them in response XML.  
  Will need to be re-looked at when final list of actual ASN-to-SMS IDs are available.

Changes in v1.2.25 (released Nov 9, 2012)

-Updated the SMS DB with a number of changes submitted by AAAS

-Removed a list of relationahip exclusions that were hard-coded in the 
vizualization engine and implemented a database driven mechanism to 
specify specific relations to omit on given maps (new column specifies maps
black-listed maps). Partially addresses an issue where relationship edges
overlap and obsucre each other when passing through intermediate
benchmark nodes along the same path as other relations.


Changes in v1.2.24 (released June 14, 2012)

-Two new built-in tabs are now available for the InfoBubble:
--Assessments - Dispalys AAAS assessments for the given Benchmark, when available
--Misconceptions - Displays AAAS miconcetpions for the given Benchmark, when available

-Added ability to set a minimum width for the InfoBubble, which is useful
to prevent tabs from wrapping when many of them are used

-Added context param to allow configuration of the aaasAssessmentsBaseURL used to pull in content for the AAAS
assessments and misconceptions tabs (defaults to 'http://assessment.aaas.org')


Changes in v1.2.23 (released April 4, 2012)

-Added link to 'PDF of map' in the map title bar to make it easier to access.

-Fixed ouput from OAI data provider. XML is now well-formed (fixed null pointer in myResultSet.java)

-Fixed improperly encoded characters in three benchmarks.

-Positioned the sub-menus in the 'Browse Topics' menu slightly higer to make them more accessible.


Changes in v1.2.22 (released Jan 28, 2012)

-Addressed issues associated with running SMS on the Rackspace server:
--Fixed intermittent error in JSON service responses and SVG-JSON CSIP responses, which were returning empty SVG strings in certain cases
--Reduced the maximum MySQL connection pool size to 30 (previously set to 200)
--Fixed issue with the database tables being dropped when the service was stopped and then restarted. 
The database is no longer dumped to the strandmap.sql file upon shutdown, which was causing the file to be deleted.
--Upgraded to Tomcat 5.5.35 (addresses a DOS vulnerability), tested and deployed to dev and production servers

-Improved error messages reported in service responses, for example to indicate the specific errors found when an invalid query was
supplied by the client.


Changes in v1.2.21 (released June 30, 2011)
- Ensured that the list of maps that a benchmark appears in is displays properly in the bubble
with the current map unlinked and all others linked, including in the related benchmarks
view

- Fixed bug where the tabs in the bubble shifted to the right when the user zoomed 
in or out with their browser [+|-]

- Moved sub menu in the global map selector slightly higher


Changes in v1.2.20 (released June 20, 2011)
- Updated code examples

Changes in v1.2.19 (released June 14, 2011)
- Added an option for the map selector widget to show a multi-level selection menu that includes the topics with each map shown in a sub-menu.
- Added a new built-in content type for the infoBubble that displays all maps that contain the given benchmark.
- Modified the wording a bit in the Search dialogs
- Updated JS API documentation with the above new features and included them in example client 1
- Removed underlines from the text that appears in the map images (strand names, grades, etc).

Changes in v1.2.18  (released May 6, 2011)
- added functionality to define which collection(s) to search over by adding a JS array for smsCollectionsRelated or smsCollectionsAligned 
containing the IDs for the collections to search over.  Updated example 6 to demonstrate this.  

Changes in v1.2.17 (released April 21, 2011)
- Changed the Search webservice to be the DDS as opposed to the NSDL NDRSEARCH.  Updated Xpaths to correspond to the new results XML format.
- Changed HTTP User-Agent header for tabs in the JS bubble UI to be 'Strand Map Service (JS API)'

Changes in v1.2.16 (released Nov 16, 2010)
- related resources tab in bubble will gets the bm keywords, subjects, grades and the corresponding strand keywords 
internally.  All that needs to be provided is the bmid and map id. This allows the 
tab content to be embedded easily into other web pages. Used in the Utah study list view page.

Changes in v1.2.15 (released Oct 22, 2010)
- fixed spelling mistakes in a number of sections, and added missing AAAS codes
- removed duplicate benchmark SMS-BMK-1990, kept SMS-BMK-1655 and reconnected it

- updated JavaScript client example 2 (coordinates with a new tutorial in the NSDL Wiki)
- added more details about each object in the JS API documentation page

Changes in v1.2.13 (released Sept 3, 2009)
- added 'AAAS' and clarification to service documentation in a few places to make it more clear that the services
(currently) operate over AAAS maps only and do not allow creation of new maps, only 
the insertion of custom content into the existing AAAS map bubble

Changes in v1.2.12 (released Jan 27, 2009)
- added a link to a PDF of the map in the print view

page view instead of directly refreshing the browser to the link
- clarified the verbiage in tooltips and labels for the print and link to page items
- 'Print view' and 'Link to this page' links are now displayed only when the interactive
map is visible rather than in all SMS page views
- fixed return value from StrandMaps.getReferringMapId() method, which was not returning
a valid ID

Changes in v1.2.11 (released Sept 5, 2008)
- added approx 40 new maps and two new chapters from Atlas II
