Sometimes this appears to be because the available evidence conflicts with the students'' beliefs.</FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="2"><Statement sequenceNumber="1"><Source><Author>Jungwirth, E.</Author><Author>Dreyfus, A.</Author><Title>Identification and acceptance of a posteriori causal assertions invalidated by faulty enquiry methodology: An international study of curricular expectations and reality</Title><Publication year="1990" type="Book" pages="202-211" editor="Herget, D.E.">More history and philosophy of science in science teaching</Publication></Source><Source><Author>Jungwirth, E.</Author><Author>Dreyfus, A.</Author><Title>After this, therefore because of this: One way of jumping to conclusions</Title><Publication year="1992" volume="26" issue="1" type="Journal" pages="139-142">Journal of Biological Education</Publication></Source><Source><Author>Jungwirth, E.</Author><Title>Avoidance of logical fallacies: A neglected aspect of science education and science-teacher education</Title><Publication year="1987" volume="5" issue="1" type="Journal" pages="43-58">Research in Science and Technological Education</Publication></Source><Text>Most high-school students will accept arguments based on inadequate sample size, accept causality from contiguous events, and accept conclusions based on statistically insignificant differences.</Text></Statement><Statement sequenceNumber="2"><Source><Author>Jungwirth, E.</Author><Author>Dreyfus, A.</Author><Title>After this, therefore because of this: One way of jumping to conclusions</Title><Publication year="1992" volume="26" type="Journal" pages="139-142">Journal of Biological Education</Publication></Source><Source><Author>Jungwirth, E.</Author><Title>Avoidance of logical fallacies: A neglected aspect of science education and science-teacher education</Title><Publication year="1987" volume="5" issue="1" type="Journal" pages="43-58">Research in Science and Technological Education</Publication></Source><Text>More students can recognize these inadequacies in arguments after prompting (for example, after being told that the conclusions drawn from the data were invalid and asked to state why).</Text></Statement><FullConceptionText>Most high-school students will accept arguments based on inadequate sample size, accept causality from contiguous events, and accept conclusions based on statistically insignificant differences.

Specially designed instruction does help high-school students change their ideas.</FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="3"><Statement sequenceNumber="1"><Source><Author>Champagne, A.</Author><Author>Gunstone, R.</Author><Author>Klopfer, L.</Author><Title>Effecting changes in cognitive structures among physics students</Title><Publication year="1985" type="Book" pages="61-90" editor="West, L.">Cognitive structure and conceptual change</Publication></Source><Text>Research has shown less success in changing middle-school students'' ideas about force and motion.</Text></Statement><Statement sequenceNumber="2"><Source><Author>White, B.</Author><Author>Horwitz, P.</Author><Title>Thinker tools: Enabling children to understand physical laws</Title><Publication year="1987" type="Report">BBN Laboratories Report.</Publication></Source><Source><Author>White, B.</Author><Title>Reconceptualizing science and engineering education</Title><Publication year="1990" type="Book" editor="White, B.">Unpublished manuscript.</Publication></Source><Text>Nevertheless, some research indicates that middle-school students can start understanding the effect of constant forces to speed up, slow down, or change the direction of motion of an object.

Finally, it may not be clear to students that some forms of energy, such as light, sound, and chemical energy, can be used to make things happen.</FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="3"><Statement sequenceNumber="1"><Source><Author>Anderson, C.</Author><Author>Sheldon, T.</Author><Author>Dubay, J.</Author><Title>The effects of instruction on college nonmajors'' conceptions of respiration and photosynthesis</Title><Publication year="1990" volume="27" issue="8" type="Journal" pages="761-776">Journal of Research in Science Teaching</Publication></Source><Text>Some students of all ages have difficulty in identifying the sources of energy for plants and also for animals. </Text></Statement><Statement sequenceNumber="2"><Source><Author>Anderson, C.</Author><Author>Sheldon, T.</Author><Author>Dubay, J.</Author><Title>The effects of instruction on college nonmajors'' conceptions of respiration and photosynthesis</Title><Publication year="1990" volume="27" issue="8" type="Journal" pages="761-776">Journal of Research in Science Teaching</Publication></Source><Text>Students tend to confuse energy and other concepts such as food, force, and temperature.

Problems using 2:1 ratios are easier than problems using n:1 ratios, and can be solved by elementary-school children. Problems using n:1 ratios are easier than problems using other integer ratios (e.g., 6/2) which in turn are easier than problems using non-integer ratios (e.g., 6/4).

Students may not be able to understand explanations of the seasons before they reasonably understand the relative size, motion, and distance of the sun and the earth. Many students before and after instruction in earth science think that winter is colder than summer because the earth is further from the sun in winter. This idea is often related to the belief that the earth orbits the sun in an elongated elliptical path. Other students, especially after instruction, think that the distance between the northern hemisphere and the sun changes because the earth leans toward the sun in the summer and away from the sun in winter. Students'' ideas about how light travels and about the earth-sun relationship, including the shape of the earth''s orbit, the period of the earth''s revolution around the sun, and the period of the earth''s rotation around its axis, may interfere with students'' understanding of the seasons. For example, some students believe that the side of the sun not facing the earth experiences winter, indicating a confusion between the daily rotation of the earth and its yearly revolution around the sun.  </FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="2">    <Statement sequenceNumber="1">        <Source>      <Author>        Sere, M.      </Author>      <Title>        The gaseous state </Title>      <Publication year="1985" type="Book" pages="105-123" editor="Driver, R.">        Children''s ideas in science      </Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Driver, R.      </Author>      <Author>        Squires, A.      </Author>      <Author>        Rushworth, P.      </Author>      <Author>        Wood-Robinson, V.      </Author>            <Title>        Making sense of secondary science: Research into children''s ideas </Title>      <Publication year="1994" type="Book">        Making sense of secondary science: Research into children''s ideas</Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>Krnel, D.</Author>      <Author>Watson, R.</Author>      <Author>Glazar, S.</Author>      <Title>        Survey of research related to the development of concept "matter" </Title>      <Publication year="1998" volume="20" issue="3" type="Journal" pages="257-289">        International Journal of Science Education      </Publication>    </Source>    <Text>      Although upper elementary students may identify air as existing even in static situations and recognize that it takes space, recognizing that air has weight may be challenging even for high-school students.    </Text>  </Statement>  <Statement sequenceNumber="2">    <Source>      <Author>        Driver, R.      </Author>      <Author>        Squires, A.      </Author>      <Author>        Rushworth, P.      </Author>      <Author>        Wood-Robinson, V.      </Author>            <Title>        Making sense of secondary science: Research into children''s ideas </Title>      <Publication year="1994" type="Book">        Making sense of secondary science: Research into children''s ideas</Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Sere, M.      </Author>      <Title>        The gaseous state </Title>      <Publication year="1985" type="Book" pages="105-123" editor="Driver, R.">        Children''s ideas in science      </Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Henriques, L.      </Author>      <Title>        Children''s ideas about weather: A review of the literature      </Title>      <Publication year="2002" volume="102" type="Journal" pages="202-215">        School Science and Mathematics      </Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Nelson, B.D.      </Author>      <Author>        Aron, R.H.      </Author>      <Author>        Francek, M.A.      </Author>            <Title>        Clarification of selected misconceptions in physical geography </Title>      <Publication year="1992" volume="91" issue="2" type="Journal" pages="76-80">        Journal of Geography      </Publication>    </Source>    <Text>      Students of all ages (including college students) may believe that air exerts force or pressure only when it is moving and only downwards.    </Text>  </Statement>    <Statement sequenceNumber="3">    <Source>      <Author>        Driver, R.      </Author>      <Author>        Squires, A.      </Author>      <Author>        Rushworth, P.      </Author>      <Author>        Wood-Robinson, V.      </Author>            <Title>        Making sense of secondary science: Research into children''s ideas </Title>      <Publication year="1994" type="Book">        Making sense of secondary science: Research into children''s ideas</Publication>    </Source>    <Text>      Only a few middle-school students use the idea of pressure differences between regions of the atmosphere to account for wind; instead they may account for winds in terms of visible moving objects or the movement of the earth.    </Text>  </Statement>  <FullConceptionText>    Although upper elementary students may identify air as existing even in static situations and recognize that it takes space, recognizing that air has weight may be challenging even for high-school students.

For many students, difficulty understanding the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere persists in middle school years. Students can understand rainfall in terms of gravity once they attribute weight to little drops of water (typically in upper elementary grades), but the mechanism through which condensation occurs may not be understood until high school.  </FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="4">  <Statement sequenceNumber="1">      <Source>      <Author>        Andersson, B.      </Author>      <Author>        Wallin, A.      </Author>      <Title>        Students'' understanding of the greenhouse effect, the societal consequences of reducing CO2 emissions and the problem of ozone layer depletion </Title>      <Publication year="2000" volume="37" issue="10" type="Journal" pages="1096-1111">        Journal of Research in Science Teaching      </Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Koulaidis, V.      </Author>      <Author>        Christidou, V.      </Author>      <Title>        Models of students'' thinking concerning the greenhouse effect and teaching implications </Title>      <Publication year="1999" volume="83" issue="5" type="Journal" pages="559-576">        Science Education      </Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Meadows, G.      </Author>      <Author>        Wiesenmayer, R.      </Author>      <Title>        Identifying and Addressing Students'' Alternative Conceptions of the Causes of Global Warming: The Need for Cognitive Conflict </Title>      <Publication year="1999" volume="8" issue="3" type="Journal" pages="235-239">        Journal of Science Education and Technology      </Publication>    </Source>        <Source>      <Author>        Rye, J.      </Author>      <Author>        Rubba, R.      </Author>      <Author>        Wiesenmayer, R.      </Author>      <Title>        An investigation of middle school students? alternative conceptions of global warming as formative evaluation of teacher-developed STS units </Title>      <Publication year="1997" volume="19" issue="5" type="Journal" pages="527-551">        International Journal of Science Education      </Publication>    </Source>        <Text>      Students of all ages may confuse the ozone layer with the greenhouse effect, and may have a tendency to imagine that all environmentally friendly actions help to solve all environmental problems (for example, that the use of unleaded petrol reduces the risk of global warming).     </Text>  </Statement>  <Statement sequenceNumber="2">      <Source>      <Author>        Andersson, B.      </Author>      <Author>        Wallin, A.      </Author>      <Title>        Students'' understanding of the greenhouse effect, the societal consequences of reducing CO2 emissions and the problem of ozone layer depletion </Title>      <Publication year="2000" volume="37" issue="10" type="Journal" pages="1096-1111">        Journal of Research in Science Teaching      </Publication>    </Source>    <Text>      Students have difficulty linking relevant elements of knowledge when explaining the greenhouse effect and may confuse the natural greenhouse effect with the enhancement of that effect.    </Text>  </Statement>  <FullConceptionText>    Students of all ages may confuse the ozone layer with the greenhouse effect, and may have a tendency to imagine that all environmentally friendly actions help to solve all environmental problems (for example, that the use of unleaded petrol reduces the risk of global warming).

Even after instruction, however, students do not seem to appreciate that energy conservation is a useful way to explain phenomena.  A key difficulty students have in understanding conservation appears to derive from not considering the appropriate system and environment.  In addition, middle- and high-school students tend to use their conceptualizations of energy to interpret energy conservation ideas.  For example, some students interpret the idea that "energy is not created or destroyed" to mean that energy is stored up in the system and can even be released again in its original form.  Or, students may believe that no energy remains at the end of a process, but may say that "energy is not lost" because an effect was caused during the process (for example, a weight was lifted).

Some students think that "cold" is being transferred from a colder to a warmer object, others that both "heat" and "cold" are transferred at the same time. Middle- and high-school students often do not explain heat conduction phenomena as interactions. For example, students sometimes think that, depending on its properties, an object which is at the same temperature with its surroundings can cool down spontaneously. Even after instruction, students don''t always give up their naive notion that some substances (for example, flour, sugar, or air) cannot heat up or that metals get hot quickly because "they attract heat," "suck heat in," or "hold heat well." Middle-school students believe different materials in the same surroundings have different temperatures because they feel different (for example, metal feels colder than wood). As a result, they may not recognize the universal tendency to temperature equalization. Helping most students develop scientific ideas in this domain appears to be possible only with long-term interventions that focus on connecting scientific ideas about rate of heat transfer, insulation/conduction, and thermal equilibrium with each other and with ideas students hold based on everyday experiences.  </FullConceptionText></Conception>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

For example, a student may say that a figure is a rectangle because it looks like a door. At the second level, students identify shapes according to their properties, and here a students might think of a rhombus as a figure with four equal sides. At the third level, students can identify relationships between classes of figures (e.g., a square is a rectangle) and can discover properties of classes of figures by simple logical deduction. At the fourth level, students can produce a short sequence of statements to logically justify a conclusion and can understand that deduction is the method of establishing geometric truth.  </FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="2">    <Statement sequenceNumber="1">        <Source>      <Author>        Clements, D.      </Author>      <Author>        Batista, M.      </Author>      <Title>        Geometry and spatial reasoning </Title>      <Publication year="1992" type="Book" pages="420-464" editor="Grouws, D.">        Handbook of research on mathematics teaching and learning</Publication>    </Source>    <Text>      Progress from one of Van Hiele''s levels to the next is more dependent upon instruction than age.

These ages will vary when different children are tested or the same children are tested in different contexts.  </FullConceptionText></Conception><Conception sequenceNumber="2">    <Statement sequenceNumber="1">    <Source>      <Author>        Stavy, R.      </Author>          <Title>        Children''s conceptions of changes in the state of matter: From liquid (or solid) to gas </Title>      <Publication year="1990" volume="27" issue="3" type="Journal" pages="247-266">        Journal of Research in Science Teaching</Publication>    </Source>        <Text>      Many students cannot discern weight conservation in some tasks until they are 15 years old.
